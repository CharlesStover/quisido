# Shared modules

Shared modules represent reusable modules that, in theory, can be exported and
deployed as standalone NPM packages.

Shared modules, unlike an otherwise flat application file structure
(`src/TYPE`), allow grouping of tightly-coupled components, constants, types,
utility functions, etc.
